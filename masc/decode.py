"""Decoding a predicted coarse cluster index back to a fine token index.

Section 3.3, "Integrating the MASC Prior".  The autoregressive model emits a
sequence of coarse cluster indices ``z^b``; before the tokenizer decoder can
render an image these must be turned back into fine token indices ``z^q``.

Two strategies are described in the paper:

* **Random Sampling (default).**  For each predicted coarse index, sample a fine
  token *uniformly at random* from that cluster's members
  ``{v_i | M(i) = z^b_t}``.  Because MASC clusters are semantically coherent
  (App. D), any member is a good representative, so this parameter-free decoder
  already yields high-quality results (Table 10).  Implemented in full below.

* **Hierarchical Decoding (extended).**  A small refinement network predicts the
  fine token within the cluster, trading +25M params for a marginal fidelity
  gain.  Only the network *interface* is provided here (``masc/refine.py``); its
  training recipe is part of the extended pipeline and is not required to
  reproduce the main results, which all use Random Sampling.
